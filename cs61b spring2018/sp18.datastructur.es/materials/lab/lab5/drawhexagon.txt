The process I used to write my hexagon building code:
1. Realized that a hexagon is just a stack of rows of tiles with a very specific pattern, where each row is determined by:
  a. Its width.
  b. Its xOffset.

2. Wrote methods for calculating width and xOffset of each row of a hexagon, along with JUnit tests to verify that these worked. The reason I chose to do JUnit tests is because it was really easy, and I knew that it would make my life a lot better when I started visually debugging my hexagon code if I knew that I could trust these methods.

3. Wrote the addHexagon method with a double nested for loop that tried to draw hexagons. Debugged for a while until it seemed to work. Unlike above, I did not bother writing JUnit tests, because writing the tests is just as hard as writing the actual method (think about why this is). Instead, I just wrote a main method that drew hexagons and made sure they looked good to my eyeballs.

4. Changed the signature of addHexagon to take Position objects instead of x and y coordinates, for reasons that will become clear in part 2 of this lab.

5. Revised my double for loop so that it uses a helper method that draws each row, so that my code is easier to read and maintain (and use for students).

Note this solution uses exceptions, which we may not have covered at the time you're reading this.
