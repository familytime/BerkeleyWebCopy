<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Minimum Spanning Trees.</strong> Given an undirected graph, a spanning tree T is a
subgraph of G, where T is connected, acyclic, includes all vertices. The minimum
spanning tree is the spanning tree whose edge weights have the smallest sum.
MSTs are similar to SPTs, but despite intuition suggesting it may be the case,
for many graphs, the MST is not the SPT for any particular vertex. See
<a href="thisgraph%20for%20an%20example%20of%20one%20for%20which%20the%20MST%20is%20a%20SPT.html">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eZ6sCoAY8d-PAfyyTRG_EQ-BBNqxmTyJ2vS10ZzsGYg/edit#slide=id.g772f8a8e2_0_191</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cut Property.</strong> If you divide the vertices up into two sets S and T
(arbitrarily), then a crossing edge is any edge which has one vertex in S and
one in T. Neat fact (the cut property): The minimum crossing edge for ANY cut is
part of the MST.</p>

<p><strong>Prim’s Algorithm.</strong> One approach for finding the MST is as follows: Starting
from any arbitrary source, repeatedly add the shortest edge that connects some
vertex in the tree to some vertex outside the tree. If the MST is unique, then
the result is independent of the source (doesn’t matter where we start). One
student at office hours likened this to the game of
<a href="Sharks%20and%20Minnows.html">http://www.wikihow.com/Play-Sharks-and-Minnows</a>, where you
catch exactly one minnow during each iteration of the algorithm. Each time, the
sharks get whichever minnow is closest to a shark.</p>

<p>Yet another way of thinking about Prim’s algorithm is that it is basically just
Dijkstra’s algorithm, but where we consider vertices in order of the distance
from the entire tree, rather than from source. Or in pseudocode, we simply
change relax so that it reads:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">relax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">source</span>
    <span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">target</span>        
    <span class="n">currentBestKnownWeight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">distTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">possiblyBetterWeight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">weight</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">Only</span> <span class="n">difference</span><span class="err">!</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">possiblyBetterWeight</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">currentBestKnownWeight</span>
        <span class="n">Use</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="n">instead</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">whatever</span> <span class="n">we</span> <span class="n">were</span> <span class="n">using</span> <span class="n">before</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the difference is very subtle! Like Dijkstra’s, the runtime is O(E log
V). We can prove that Prim’s works because of the cut property.</p>

<p><strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm.</strong> As an alternate algorithm and as a showcasing of
various data structures in the course, we also considered Kruskal’s algorithm
for finding an MST. It performs the exact same task as Prim’s, namely finding an
MST, albeit in a different manner. In pseudocode, Kruskal’s algorithm is simply:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Initialize</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">MST</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">empty</span>
<span class="n">Consider</span> <span class="n">each</span> <span class="n">edge</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">INCREASING</span> <span class="n">order</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">weight</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">If</span> <span class="n">adding</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">MST</span> <span class="n">does</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">cycle</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">add</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">e</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! The runtime for Kruskal’s, assuming that we already have all of our
edges in a sorted list and use a weighted quick union with path compression to
detect cycles, is O(E log*V), or (E log E) if we have use a PQ instead. See
slides for more details. We can prove that Kruskal’s works because of the cut
property.</p>

<p>Completely unimportant technical note: We can actually make an even tighter
bound than $O(E \log*V)$ if we use the inverse Ackermann bound for WQUPC.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Would Kruskal or Prim’s algorithm work on a directed graph?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True or false: Adding a constant to every edge weight does not change the
solution to the MST problem (assume unique edge weights).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True or false: Multiplying all edges weights with a constant does not change
the solution to the MST problem (assume unique edge weights).</p>

  </li>

</ol>

<h3 id="b-level">B level</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Adapted from Algorithms 4.3.8. Prove the following, known as the cycle
property: Given any cycle in an edge weighted graph (all edge weights
distinct), the edge of maximum weight in the cycle does not belong to the MST
of the graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problem 3 from <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-f09.pdf#page=5">Princeton’s Fall 2009 final</a> (part d is pretty hard).</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adapted from Algorithms 4.3.12. Suppose that a graph has distinct edge
weights. Does its shortest edge have to belong to the MST? Can its longest
edge belong to the MST? Does a min-weight edge on every cycle have to belong
to the MST? Prove your answer to each question or give a counterexample.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adapted from Algorithms 4.3.20. True or false: At any point during the
execution of Kruskal’s algorithm, each vertex is closer to some vertex in its
subtree than to any vertex not in its subtree. Prove your answer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True or False: Given any two components that are generated as Kruskal’s
algorithm is running (but before it has completed), the smallest edge
connecting those two components is part of the MST.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h3 id="a-level">A level</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Problem 3 from <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-s08.pdf#page=4">Princeton’s Spring 2008 final</a>.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rigorously prove the following: For any cut C, if the weight of any edge e is smaller than all the other edges across C, then this edge is part of the Minimum Spanning Tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adapted from Textbook 4.3.26: An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would
cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. Show how to find
all critical edges in a graph in time proportional to E log E . Note : This
question assumes that edge weights are not necessarily distinct (otherwise
all edges in the MST are critical).</p>
