<h2 id='starter-files'>Starter Files</h2>


<p>Download <a href="lab00.zip">lab00.zip</a>.
Inside the archive, you will find starter files for the questions in this lab,
  along with a copy of the <a href="ok.zip">Ok</a> autograder.</p>


<h2 id='submission'>Submission</h2>

<p>By the end of this lab, you should have submitted the lab with
<code>python3 ok --submit</code>. You may submit more than once before the
deadline; only the final submission will be graded.
Check that you have successfully submitted your code on
<a href="https://okpy.org/">okpy.org</a>.</p>





    
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>This lab explains how to use your own computer to complete assignments for CS
61A. If you are using a lab computer, most of the instructions are the same,
except you won't have to install anything.</p>

<p>If you need any help at any time through the lab we are holding special
<a href="../../office-hours.html">office hours</a> this week. You can also ask
any questions next week in <a href="../../office-hours.html">office hours</a>
or in lab.</p>


<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>



<h3 id="register-for-an-account">Register for an account</h3>


<blockquote><p>These accounts allow you to use instructional machines in the CS department,
which can be useful if you do not have regular access to a computer. They are
<strong>not required if you do not plan on using the lab computers or printers</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://acropolis.cs.berkeley.edu/~account/webacct/">EECS account site</a>
to register for an instructional account. Login using your Berkeley CalNet ID
and click the <code>Get a new account</code> button in the row for CS 61A. Your username
will be of the form cs61a-xxx. Write down or download your account form so you
don't forget it!</p>


<h3 id="install-a-terminal">Install a terminal</h3>


<p>The terminal is a program that allows you to interact with your computer
by entering commands. No matter what operating system you use (Windows,
macOS, Linux), the terminal will be an essential tool for CS 61A.</p>


<h4 id="macos-linux">macOS/Linux</h4>


<p>If you're on a Mac or are using a form of Linux (such as Ubuntu), you already
have a program called <code>Terminal</code> or something similar on your computer.  Open
that up and you should be good to go.</p>


<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>


<p>For Windows users, we recommend downloading a terminal called <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git
Bash</a>.</p>

<p>You should be able to install Git Bash with most of the default configuration
options, with one exception. In the <em>Configuring the terminal emulator to use
with Git Bash</em> step, select the second option: <em>Use Windows' default console
window</em>.</p>

<p><strong>This is very important! If you do not select this option, your terminal will
not work!</strong></p>

<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/git-bash-options.png" alt="Git Bash configuration options"></p>


<h3 id="install-python-3">Install Python 3</h3>


<p>Python 3 is the primary programming language used in this course. Use the appropriate
download link and additional instructions below to install the Python 3 interpreter.</p>

<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>

<p>Refer to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smHuBHxJdK8">video</a> for additional help on setting
up Python (the video features a slightly older version of Python 3, but the
steps are still the same).</p>

<p>You may need to right-click the download icon and select "Open". After installing
please close and open your Terminal.</p>


<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<p>When installing, make sure to check the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH"
box, which will allow you to execute the <code>python</code> command from your terminal.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/python-windows-install-path.png" alt="Windows PATH at setup"></p>

<p>After installing please close and open your Terminal.</p>


<h3 id="install-a-text-editor">Install a text editor</h3>


<p>The <strong>Python interpreter</strong> that you just installed allows you to <em>run</em> Python
code. You will also need a <strong>text editor</strong>, where you will <em>write</em> Python code.</p>

<p>There are many editors out there, each with its own set of features. We find
that <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> are popular choices among students,
but you are free to use other text editors.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Please, please, <em>please</em> do not use word processors such as
Microsoft Word to edit programs.</p></blockquote>

<p>For your reference, we've also written some guides on using popular text
editors. After you're done with lab, you can take a look if you're interested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../articles/atom.html">Atom</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../articles/sublime.html">Sublime Text 3</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../articles/emacs.html">Emacs</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../articles/vim.html">Vim</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="using-the-terminal">Using the terminal</h2>


<p>Let's check if everything was installed properly! First, open a new terminal window, 
if you haven't already.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/terminal.png" alt="starting the terminal"></p>

<p>When you first open your terminal, you will start in the home directory.  The
<strong>home directory</strong> is represented by the <code>~</code> symbol.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don't worry if your terminal window doesn't look exactly the same; the
important part is that the text on the left-hand side of the <code>$</code> has a
<code>~</code> (tilde). That text might also have the name of your computer.</p></blockquote>


<h4 id="python-interpreter">Python Interpreter</h4>


<p>We can use the terminal to check if your Python 3 interpreter was installed 
correctly. Try the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3</code></pre>

<p>If the installation worked, you should see some text printed out about the
interpreter followed by <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> on its own line. This is where you can type in Python 
code. Try typing some expressions you saw in lecture, or just play around to see 
what happens! You can type <code>exit()</code> or <code>Ctrl&#x2d;D</code> to return to your command line.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are using Windows and the <code>python3</code> command doesn't work, try using just 
<code>python</code> or <code>py</code>. If neither of those work, make sure you set up your PATH correctly
as shown above. Ask for help if you get stuck!</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="organizing-your-files">Organizing your files</h2>


<p>In this section, you will learn how to manage files using terminal commands.</p>


<h3 id="directories">Directories</h3>


<p>The first command you'll use is <code>ls</code>. Try typing it in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>ls</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ls</code> command <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>ts all the files and folders in the current
directory. A <strong>directory</strong> is another name for a folder (such as the
<code>Documents</code> folder). Since you're in the home directory right now, you
should see the contents of your home directory.</p>


<h3 id="changing-directories">Changing directories</h3>


<p>To move into another directory, use the <code>cd</code> command. Let's try moving into your
Desktop directory. First, make sure you're in your home directory (check for the
<code>~</code> on your command line) and use <code>ls</code> to see if the <code>Desktop</code> directory is present.
Try typing the following command into your terminal, which should move you into
that directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd Desktop</code></pre>

<p>If your desktop directory is not located within your home directory and you can't
find it, ask a TA or a lab assistant for help.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to return to the home directory:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>cd ..</code> (two dots). The <code>..</code> means "the parent directory". In
  this case, the parent directory of <code>cs61a</code> is your home
  directory, so you can use <code>cd ..</code> to go up one directory.</li>
  <li><code>cd ~</code> (the tilde). Remember that <code>~</code> means home directory, so
  this command will always change to your home directory.</li>
  <li><code>cd</code> (<code>cd</code> on its own). Typing just <code>cd</code> is a shortcut for typing <code>cd ~</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>You do not have to keep your files on your Desktop if you prefer otherwise.
Where you keep your files locally will not affect your grade. Do whatever is
easiest and most convenient for you!</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="making-new-directories">Making new directories</h3>


<p>The next command is called <code>mkdir</code>, which <strong>m</strong>a<strong>k</strong>es new
<strong>dir</strong>ectories. Let's make a directory called <code>cs61a</code> on your Desktop to store
all of the assignments for this class:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir cs61a</code></pre>

<p>A folder named <code>cs61a</code> will appear on your Desktop. You can verify this by
using the <code>ls</code> command again or by simply checking your Desktop.</p>

<p>At this point, let's create some more directories. First, make sure you are in
the <code>~/Desktop/cs61a</code> directory. Then, create folders called <code>projects</code> and <code>lab</code>
inside of your <code>cs61a</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/Desktop/cs61a
mkdir projects
mkdir lab</code></pre>

<p>Now if you list the contents of the directory (using <code>ls</code>), you'll see two
folders, <code>projects</code> and <code>lab</code>.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/terminal_commands.png" alt="cs61a directory"></p>


<h3 id="downloading-the-assignment">Downloading the assignment</h3>


<p>If you haven't already, download the zip archive, <a href="lab00.zip">lab00.zip</a>, which
contains all the files that you'll need for this lab. Once you've done that, let's
find the downloaded file. On most computers, <code>lab00.zip</code> is probably located in a
directory called <code>Downloads</code> in your home directory. Use the <code>ls</code> command to
check:</p>

<pre><code>ls ~/Downloads</code></pre>

<p>If you don't see <code>lab00.zip</code>, ask a TA or lab assistant for help.</p>


<h3 id="extracting-starter-files">Extracting starter files</h3>


<p>You must expand the zip archive before you can work on the lab files.
Different operating systems and different browsers have different ways of
unzipping. If you don't know how, you can search online.</p>

<blockquote><p>Using a terminal, you can unzip the zip file from the command line.
First, <code>cd</code> into the directory that contains the zip file:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/Downloads</code></pre>

<p>Now, run the <code>unzip</code> command with the name of the zip file:</p>

<pre><code>unzip lab00.zip</code></pre>

<p>You might also be able to unzip files without using the terminal by double
clicking them in your OS's file explorer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once you unzip <code>lab00.zip</code>, you'll have a new folder called <code>lab00</code> which
contains the following files (check it out with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>lab00.py</code>: The template file you'll be adding your code to</li>
  <li><code>ok</code>: A program used to test and submit assignments</li>
  <li><code>lab00.ok</code>: A configuration file for <code>ok</code></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="moving-files">Moving files</h3>


<p>Move the lab files to the lab folder you created earlier:</p>

<pre><code>mv ~/Downloads/lab00 ~/Desktop/cs61a/lab</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mv</code> command will <strong>m</strong>o<strong>v</strong>e the <code>~/Downloads/lab00</code> folder
into the <code>~/Desktop/cs61a/lab</code> folder.</p>

<p>Now, go to the <code>lab00</code> folder that you just moved. Try using <code>cd</code> to navigate
your own way! If you get stuck, you can use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/Desktop/cs61a/lab/lab00</code></pre>


<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>


<p>Here is a summary of the commands we just went over for your reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ls</code>: <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>ts all files in the current directory</li>
  <li><code>cd &lt;path to directory&gt;</code>: <strong>c</strong>hange into the specified <strong>d</strong>irectory</li>
  <li><code>mkdir &lt;directory name&gt;</code>: <strong>m</strong>a<strong>k</strong>e a new <strong>dir</strong>ectory with the given name</li>
  <li><code>mv &lt;source path&gt; &lt;destination path&gt;</code>: <strong>m</strong>o<strong>v</strong>e the file at the given source to the
  given destination</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, you're ready to start editing the lab files! Don't worry if this seems
complicated -- it will get much easier over time. Just keep practicing!
You can also take a look at our <a href="../../articles/unix.html">UNIX tutorial</a> for a more
detailed explanation of terminal commands.</p>


<h2 id="doing-the-assignment">Doing the assignment</h2>



<h3 id="understanding-the-question">Understanding the question</h3>


<p>Open up <code>lab00.py</code> in your text editor. You can type <code>open .</code> on MacOS or <code>start .</code>
on Windows to open the current directory in your Finder/File Explorer. Then
double click or right click to open the file in your text editor. You should
see something like this:</p>



<pre><code>def twenty_eighteen():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Come up with the most creative expression that evaluates to 2018,
    using only numbers and the +, *, and &#x2d; operators.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; twenty_eighteen()
    2018
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
<div class="alt solution-1">    return ______
</div><div class="solution solution-1">&#x20;&#x20;&#x20;&#x20;&#x72;&#x65;&#x74;&#x75;&#x72;&#x6e;&#x20;&#x28;&#x28;&#x28;&#x32;&#x20;&#x2b;&#x20;&#x30;&#x29;&#x20;&#x2d;&#x20;&#x31;&#x29;&#x20;&#x2a;&#x20;&#x38;&#x29;&#x20;&#x2a;&#x20;&#x38;&#x20;&#x2a;&#x20;&#x38;&#x20;&#x2a;&#x20;&#x34;&#x20;&#x2d;&#x20;&#x33;&#x30;</div></code></pre>


        <button id='solution-1' class='btn btn-outline btn-lg toggle solution'>
        Toggle Solution<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        

<p>The lines in the triple-quotes <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> are called a <strong>docstring</strong>, which is a
description of what the function is supposed to do. When writing code in 61A,
you should always read the docstring!</p>

<p>The lines that begin with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> are called <strong>doctests</strong>. Recall that when using the
Python interpreter, you write Python expressions next to <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and the output is
printed below that line. Doctests explain what the function does by showing actual
Python code: "if we input this Python code, what should the expected output be?"</p>

<p>In <code>twenty_eighteen</code>,</p>

<ul>
  <li>The docstring tells you to "come up with the most creative expression that
  evaluates to 2018," but that you can only use numbers and arithmetic operators
  <code>+</code> (add), <code>*</code> (multiply), and <code>&#x2d;</code> (subtract).</li>
  <li>The doctest checks that the function call <code>twenty_eighteen()</code> should
  return the number 2018.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>You generally will not need to modify the docstring, unless you want to add
your own tests!
The only part of your assignments that you'll need to edit is the code.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="writing-code">Writing code</h3>


<p>Once you understand what the question is asking, you're ready to start writing
code! You should replace the underscores in <code>return ______</code> with an expression that
evaluates to 2018.  What's the most creative expression you can come up with?</p>

<blockquote><p>Don't forget to save your assignment after you edit it! You can save by navigating
to File > Save or by pressing Command-S on MacOS or Ctrl-S on Windows.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>


<p>In CS 61A, we will use a program called <code>ok</code> to test our code. <code>ok</code> will be
included in every assignment in this class.</p>

<p>Back to the terminal! Make sure you are in the <code>lab00</code> directory we created
earlier (remember, the <code>cd</code> command lets you <a href="#changing-directories">change
directories</a>).</p>

<p>In that directory, you can type <code>ls</code> to verify that there are the following
three files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>lab00.py</code>: the starter file you just edited</li>
  <li><code>ok</code>: our testing program</li>
  <li><code>lab00.ok</code>: a configuration file for Ok</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's test our code to make sure it works. You can run <code>ok</code> with this
command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>The first time you run Ok, you will be prompted for your bCourses
email. Please follow <a href="../../articles/using-ok.html#signing-in-with-ok">these directions</a>. We use this
information to associate your code with you when grading.</p>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>Remember, if you are using Windows and the <code>python3</code> command doesn't work, try using just
<code>python</code> or <code>py</code>. See the the <a href="#install-python-3">install Python 3</a> section for more
info and ask for help if you get stuck!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you wrote your code correctly, you should see a successful test:</p>

<p>Now that you have completed your first CS 61A assignment, it's time to turn it
in. Note that it is <strong>not</strong> receive credit for an assignment simply by running
the autograder per the last section. You must follow these steps to submit and get
points!</p>


<h3 id="step-1-submit-with-ok">Step 1: Submit with <code>ok</code></h3>


<p>In your terminal, make sure you are in the directory that contains <code>ok</code>. If
you aren't there yet, you can use this command:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/Desktop/cs61a/lab/lab00</code></pre>

<p>Next, use <code>ok</code> with the <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;submit</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;submit</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for an email address if you haven't run Ok before. Please
follow <a href="../../articles/using-ok.html#signing-in-with-ok">these directions</a>.
After that, Ok will print out a message like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Submitting... 100% complete
Backup successful for user: ...
URL: https://okpy.org/...</code></pre>


<h3 id="step-2-verify-your-submission">Step 2: Verify your submission</h3>


<p>You can follow the link that Ok printed out to see your final submission, or you
can go to <a href="https://okpy.org/">okpy.org</a>. You will be able to view your
submission after you log in.</p>

<blockquote><p>Make sure you log in with the same email you provided when running <code>ok</code> from
your terminal!</p></blockquote>

<p>You should see a successful submission for Lab 0.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations</strong>, you just submitted your first CS 61A assignment!</p>

<blockquote><p>More information on Ok is available <a href="../../articles/using-ok.html">here</a>. You can also use the <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;help</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;help</code></pre>

<p>This flag works just like it does for UNIX commands we used earlier.</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="using-class-account">Appendix: Using your class account</h2>


<p>The following is optional. Please only read if you plan on using an
instructional account.</p>


<h3 id="logging-into-your-class-account">Logging into your class account</h3>



<h4 id="from-your-laptop">From your laptop</h4>


<p>Most of the work in this class can be done without logging into your account.
However, there may be times when you'll find working from an instructional
account to be easier.</p>

<p>Let's log in now. Open up your terminal and type in the following
command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh cs61a&#x2d;?@ashby.cs.berkeley.edu</code></pre>

<p>where <code>?</code> is replaced with the rest of your username.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're interested, here's an explanation of what the command does:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>ssh</code> is a <strong>s</strong>ecure <strong>sh</strong>ell (i.e. terminal) that connects to other
  computers over a network.</li>
  <li><code>cs61a&#x2d;?</code> is the username on the remote computer.</li>
  <li><code>ashby.cs.berkeley.edu</code> is the domain name of the remote computer.
  For our purposes it can be any of the <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/clients.cgi?choice=13&amp;string=">servers</a> that belong to Berkeley's CS department.</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>You can also watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irwlU7esODA">video</a> for help.</p>

<p>The first time you attempt to <code>ssh</code> to a new server, the following message will
appear:</p>

<pre><code>The authenticity of host &#x27;ashby.cs.berkeley.edu&#x27; can&#x27;t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is ...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</code></pre>

<p>Say yes. Your computer will remember the remote server, and won't ask you again.</p>

<p>Once you confirm, you will be prompted for your password. If you haven't
changed your password yet, use the password you were assigned when you
registered for your account.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you type your password, nothing will show up! This is a security
feature, not a bug. Continue typing and press enter to log in.</p></blockquote>


<h4 id="from-an-instructional-machine">From an instructional machine</h4>


<p>Most of our instructional computers use Ubuntu, a version of the Linux operating
system. To log in, just find a lab computer and enter your username and password.</p>

<p>Once you log in, you'll want to open a terminal. On Ubuntu, you can open a
terminal with <code>Ctrl&#x2d;Alt&#x2d;T</code>.</p>


<h3 id="changing-your-password">Changing your password</h3>


<p>The temporary password is not the easiest thing to remember. While
still logged in, you can change your password by running this command
and following the directions on the screen.</p>

<pre><code>ssh update</code></pre>


<h3 id="registering-your-account">Registering your account</h3>


<p>The first time you log in to your class account, your terminal may ask
you some registration questions about the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last name</li>
  <li>First name</li>
  <li>Student ID</li>
  <li>Email (please use the same email as above!)</li>
  <li>Code name (we don't use this information, you can enter anything you
  want)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>If your terminal doesn't prompt you for this information the first
time you log in, you can type <code>register</code> to begin the process. You
don't need to do this again if you've already registered before.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you find errors (e.g. you misspelled your name), fix them immediately by
running the command:</p>

<pre><code>re&#x2d;register</code></pre>


<h3 id="logging-out">Logging out</h3>


<p>Once you've registered your account and changed your password, you can
log out by pressing <code>Ctrl&#x2d;D</code>, or with the command <code>exit</code>.</p>


<h2 id="appendix-useful-python-command-line-options">Appendix: Useful Python command line options</h2>

<p>When running a Python file, you can use <strong>options</strong> on the command line
to inspect your code further. Here are a few that will come in handy.
If you want to learn more about other Python command-line options, take a look
at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/using/cmdline.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Using no command-line options will run the code in the file you
  provide and return you to the command line.</p>

<pre><code>python3 lab00.py</code></pre></li>
  <li><p><strong><code>&#x2d;i</code></strong>: The <code>&#x2d;i</code> option runs your Python script, then opens an interactive
  session. In an interactive session, you run Python code line by line and get
  immediate feedback instead of running an entire file all at once. To exit,
  type <code>exit()</code> into the interpreter prompt. You can also use the keyboard
  shortcut <code>Ctrl&#x2d;D</code> on Linux/Mac machines or <code>Ctrl&#x2d;Z  Enter</code> on Windows.</p>

  <p>If you edit the Python file while running it interactively, you will need to
  exit and restart the interpreter in order for those changes to take effect.</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;i lab00.py</code></pre></li>
  <li><p><strong><code>&#x2d;m doctest</code></strong>: Runs doctests in a particular file. Doctests are
  surrounded by triple quotes (<code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>) within functions. Each test consists of
  <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> followed by some Python code and the expected output.</p>

<pre><code> python3 &#x2d;m doctest lab00.py</code></pre></li>
