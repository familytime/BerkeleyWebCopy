<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note:</strong> For full credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submit with Phase 1 complete by <strong>Monday, January 29</strong> (worth 1 pt).
  <strong>You must work on this part on your own.</strong></li>
  <li>Submit with Phases 2 and 3 complete by <strong>Thursday, February 1</strong>. <strong>You
  may work with one other partner.</strong> You will get an extra credit point
  for submitting the entire project by Wednesday, January 31.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that although the checkpoint date is only a few days from the
final due date, you should not put off completing Phase 1. We recommend starting
and finishing Phase 1 as soon as possible to give yourself adequate time to
complete Phases 2 and 3, which are harder and more time consuming. You do <em>not</em>
have to wait until after the checkpoint date to start Phases 2 and 3.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and
<em>higher-order functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2 through
1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>.</p>

<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with
at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number
of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the
dice outcomes.</p>

<p>To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Pig Out</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is 1.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
    score 1 point for the turn.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
    Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Free Bacon</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores 2 more
  than the absolute difference between the digits in the opponent's total score.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: If the opponent has 42 points, the current player gains 2 +
    abs(4 - 2) = 4 points by rolling zero dice.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: If the opponent has 48 points, the current player gains
    2 + abs(4 - 8) = 6 points by rolling zero dice.</li>
    <li><em>Example 3</em>: If the opponent has 7 points, the current player gains
    2 + abs(0 - 7) = 9 points by rolling zero dice.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Swine Swap</strong>. After points for the turn are added to the current player's
  score, if both scores are larger than 1 and either one of the scores is a
  positive integer multiple of the other, then the two scores are swapped.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The current player has a total score of 37 and the opponent
    has 92. The current player rolls two dice that total 9. The opponent's
    score (92) is exactly twice the player's new total score (46). These
    scores are swapped! The current player now has 92 points and the opponent
    has 46. The turn ends.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The current player has 91 and the opponent has 37. The
    current player rolls five dice that total 20. The current player has 111,
    which is 3 times 37, so the scores are swapped. The opponent ends the turn
    with 111 and wins the game.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>


<p>This is a 2-week project. This project has two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Part I:</strong> Complete Phase 1 of the project and submit by <strong>Monday, January 29</strong>.
  <strong>You must work on this part on your own.</strong> You should not share your code from
  this part with any other students (except with your partner in Part II after
  you've both completed Part I). This is worth 1 point of your project grade; you
  must pass all OK tests for Phase 1 in order to receive this point.</li>
  <li><strong>Part II:</strong> Complete Phases 2 and 3 of the project and submit by <strong>Thursday,
  February 1</strong>. <strong>You may work with one other partner.</strong> You may share your code
  from Part 1 with your partner. You should not share any part of your code with
  students who are not your partner or copy from anyone else's solutions. In the
  end, you will submit one project for both partners.</li>
</ul>



<p><p>You can earn an additional bonus point by submitting Part II of the project at least
24 hours before the deadline.</p></p>



<p>The project is worth 20 points. 17 points are assigned for correctness, 1 point for
submitting Part I by the checkpoint date, and 2 points for the overall
<a href="#">composition</a>.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="http://ok.cs61a.org/">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <b>not</b> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations, but
there are two things you should be aware of.</p>

<p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: The Game of Hog
Ok, version ...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue.</p>

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, use the <code>--local</code> option when invoking
<code>ok</code>.  With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>


<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you.
At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the
game logic.  Once you complete the <code>play</code> function, you will be able
to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>In order to render the graphics, make sure you have Tkinter, Python's
main graphics library, installed on your computer. Once you've done
that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>Once you complete the project, if you completed the optional Problem 12,
you can play against the final strategy that you've created!</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-1-simulator">Phase 1: Simulator</h2>


<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note:</strong> For full credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit with Phase 1 complete by <strong>Monday, January 29</strong> (worth 1 pt).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You must work on this part on your own.</strong> All Phase 1 tests must pass
  in order to receive this point.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument
functions. These functions are non-pure because they may have
different return values each time they are called. The documentation
of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different types of dice used in the
project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
  probability. Example: <code>six_sided</code>.</li>
  <li>For testing functions that use dice, deterministic test dice always cycle
  through a fixed sequence of values that are passed as arguments to the
  <code>make_test_dice</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we start writing any code, read over the <code>dice.py</code> file and check your
understanding by unlocking the following tests.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 00 -u</code></pre>

<p>This should display a prompt that looks like this:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice = make_test_dice(4, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice()
?</code></pre>

<p>You should type in what you expect the output to be. To do so, you
need to first figure out what <code>test_dice</code> will do, based on the
description above.</p>

<p>You can exit the unlocker by typing <code>exit()</code> (without quotes). <strong>Typing Ctrl-C
on Windows to exit out of the unlocker has been known to cause problems, so
avoid doing so.</strong></p>


<h3 id="problem-1-2-pt">Problem 1 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two arguments: a
positive integer called <code>num_rolls</code> giving the number of dice to roll and a
<code>dice</code> function. It returns the number of points scored by rolling the dice that
number of times in a turn: either the sum of the outcomes or 1 (<em>Pig Out</em>).</p>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You should call
<code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times in the body of <code>roll_dice</code>. Remember to call
<code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times even if Pig Out happens in the middle of
rolling. In this way, we correctly simulate rolling all the dice together.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the problem</strong>:</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p><strong>Write code and check your work</strong>:</p>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01</code></pre>

<p><strong>Debugging your code interactively</strong>:</p>

<p>If the tests don't pass, it's time to debug. You can observe the behavior of
your function using Python directly. First, start the Python interpreter and
load the <code>hog.py</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;i hog.py</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can call your <code>roll_dice</code> function on any number of dice you want.
The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values">default argument value</a> for <code>dice</code> that is
a random six-sided dice function. Therefore, the following call to <code>roll_dice</code>
simulates rolling four fair six-sided dice.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(4)</code></pre>

<p>You will find that the previous expression may have a different result each time
you call it, since it is simiulating random dice rolls. You can also use test dice
that fix the outcomes of the dice in advance. For example, rolling twice when you
know that the dice will come up 3 and 4 should give a total outcome of 7.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fixed_dice = make_test_dice(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, dice=fixed_dice)
7</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>On most systems, you can evaluate the same expression again by pressing the
up arrow or Control-P, then pressing enter or return.</p>

<p>If you find a problem, you need to change your <code>hog.py</code> file, save it, quit
Python, start it again, and then start evaluating expressions. Pressing the
up arrow should give you access to your previous expressions, even after
restarting Python.</p></blockquote>

<p>Continue debugging your code and running the <code>ok</code> tests until they all pass. You
should follow this same procedure of understanding the problem, implementing a
solution, testing, and debugging for all the problems on this project.</p>


<h3 id="problem-2-1-pt">Problem 2 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>free_bacon</code> helper function that returns the number of points
scored by rolling 0 dice, based on the opponent's current <code>score</code>. You can
assume that <code>score</code> is less than 100. For a score less than 10, assume that the
first of the two digits is 0.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 02 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 02</code></pre>

<p>As noted above, you can also test <code>free_bacon</code> interactively by entering
<code>python3 &#x2d;i hog.py</code> in the terminal and then calling <code>free_bacon</code> with various
inputs.</p>


<h3 id="problem-3-1-pt">Problem 3 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>take_turn</code> function, which returns the number of points scored
for a turn by rolling the given <code>dice</code> <code>num_rolls</code> times.</p>

<p>You will need to implement the <em>Free Bacon</em> rule based on <code>opponent_score</code>, which
you can assume is less than 100.</p>

<p>Your implementation of <code>take_turn</code> should call both <code>roll_dice</code> and <code>free_bacon</code>
when possible.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 03 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 03</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-4-1-pt">Problem 4 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>is_swap</code>, which returns whether or not the scores should be
swapped because one is an integer multiple of the other.</p>

<p>The <code>is_swap</code> function takes two arguments: the players' scores. It returns a
boolean value to indicate whether the <em>Swine Swap</em> condition is met.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 04 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 04</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-5-2-pt">Problem 5 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of Hog. Players
alternate turns, each using their respective strategy function (Player 0 uses
<code>strategy0</code>, etc.), until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score. When the
game ends, <code>play</code> returns the final total scores of both players, with Player
0's score first, and Player 1's score second.</p>

<p>Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should use the functions you have already written! You will need to call
  <code>take_turn</code> with all three arguments.</li>
  <li>Only call <code>take_turn</code> once per turn.</li>
  <li>Enforce all the special rules.</li>
  <li>You can get the number of the other player (either 0 or 1) by calling
  the provided function <code>other</code>.</li>
  <li>You can ignore the <code>say</code> argument to the <code>play</code> function for now. You will use
  it in Phase 2 of the project.</li>
  <li>A <em>strategy</em> is a function that, given a player's score and their opponent's
  score, returns how many dice the player wants to roll. A strategy function
  (such as <code>strategy0</code> and <code>strategy1</code>) takes two arguments: scores for the
  current player and opposing player, which both must be non-negative
  integers. A strategy function returns the number of dice that the current
  player wants to roll in the turn. Each strategy function should be called only
  once per turn. Don't worry about the details of implementing strategies
  yet. You will develop them in Phase 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 05 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 05</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>The last test for Question 5 is a <em>fuzz test</em>, which checks that your <code>play</code>
function works for a large number of different inputs. Failing this test means
something is wrong, but you should look at other tests to see where the
problem might be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once you are finished, you will be able to play a graphical version of
the game. We have provided a file called <code>hog_gui.py</code> that
you can run from the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>If you don't already have Tkinter (Python's graphics library)
installed, you'll need to install it first before you can run the GUI.</p>

<p>The GUI relies on your implementation, so if you have any bugs in your
code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use
the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests
first.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have finished Phase 1 of this project!</p>


<h2 id="phase-2-commentary">Phase 2: Commentary</h2>


<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note:</strong> For full credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit with Phase 2 and 3 complete by <strong>Thursday, February 1</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You may work with one other partner.</strong> You will get an extra credit point
 for submitting the entire project by Wednesday, January 31.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the second phase, you will implement commentary functions that print remarks
about the game after each turn, such as, <code>&quot;22 points! That&#x27;s the biggest gain yet
for Player 1.&quot;</code></p>

<p>A commentary function takes two arguments, Player 0's current score and Player
1's current score. It can print out commentary based on either or both current
scores and possibly even previous scores. Since commentary can differ from turn
to turn depending on the current point situation in the game, commentary functions
return another commentary function to be called on the next turn. The only side
effect of a commentary function should be to print.</p>


<h3 id="commentary-examples">Commentary examples</h3>


<p>The function <code>say_scores</code> in <code>hog.py</code> is an example of a commentary function that
simply announces both players' scores. Note that <code>say_scores</code> returns a reference
to itself, meaning that the same commentary function will be called each turn.</p>

<pre><code>def say_scores(score0, score1):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A commentary function that announces the score for each player.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    print(&quot;Player 0 now has&quot;, score0, &quot;and Player 1 now has&quot;, score1)
    return say_scores</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>announce_lead_changes</code> is an example of a higher-order function
that returns a commentary function that tracks lead changes.</p>

<pre><code>def announce_lead_changes(previous_leader=None):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a commentary function that announces lead changes.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; f0 = announce_lead_changes()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f1 = f0(5, 0)
    Player 0 takes the lead by 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f2 = f1(5, 12)
    Player 1 takes the lead by 7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f3 = f2(8, 12)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f4 = f3(8, 13)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f5 = f4(15, 13)
    Player 0 takes the lead by 2
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def say(score0, score1):
        if score0 &gt; score1:
            leader = 0
        elif score1 &gt; score0:
            leader = 1
        else:
            leader = None
        if leader != None and leader != previous_leader:
            print(&#x27;Player&#x27;, leader, &#x27;takes the lead by&#x27;, abs(score0 &#x2d; score1))
        return announce_lead_changes(leader)
    return say</code></pre>

<p>You should also understand the function <code>both</code>, which takes two commentary
functions (<code>f</code> and <code>g</code>) and returns a <em>new</em> commentary function. This returned
commentary function returns <em>another</em> commentary function which calls the functions
returned by calling <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, in that order.</p>

<pre><code>def both(f, g):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a commentary function that says what f says, then what g says.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; h0 = both(say_scores, announce_lead_changes())
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h1 = h0(10, 0)
    Player 0 now has 10 and Player 1 now has 0
    Player 0 takes the lead by 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h2 = h1(10, 6)
    Player 0 now has 10 and Player 1 now has 6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h3 = h2(6, 18) # Player 0 gets 8 points, then Swine Swap applies
    Player 0 now has 6 and Player 1 now has 18
    Player 1 takes the lead by 12
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def say(score0, score1):
        return both(f(score0, score1), g(score0, score1))
    return say</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pt">Problem 6 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Update your <code>play</code> function so that a commentary function is called at the end
of each turn. The return value of calling a commentary function gives you the
commentary function to call on the next turn.</p>

<p>For example, <code>say(score0, score1)</code> should be called at the end of the first
turn. Its return value (another commentary function) should be called at the end
of the second turn. Each consecutive turn, call the function that was returned
by the call to the previous turn's commentary function.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 06 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 06</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-7-2-pt">Problem 7 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>announce_highest</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
returns a commentary function. This commentary function announces whenever a
particular player gains more points in a turn than ever before. To compute the
gain, it must compare the score from last turn to the score from this turn for
the player of interest, which is designated by the <code>who</code> argument. This function
must also keep track of the highest gain for the player so far.</p>

<p>The way in which <code>announce_highest</code> announces is very specific, and your
implementation should match the doctests provided. Notice in particular that if
the gain is only 1 point, then the message includes "point" in singular form. If
the gain is larger, then the message includes "points" in plural form.</p>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 07</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint.</strong> The <code>announce_lead_changes</code> function provided to you is an example of
how to keep track of information using commentary functions. If you are stuck,
first make sure you understand how <code>announce_lead_changes</code> works.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you are done, if play the game again, you will see the commentary.</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>The commentary in the GUI is generated by passing the following function as the
<code>say</code> argument to <code>play</code>.</p>

<pre><code>both(announce_highest(0), both(announce_highest(1), announce_lead_changes()))</code></pre>

<p>Great work! You just finished Phase 2 of the project!</p>


<h2 id="phase-3-strategies">Phase 3: Strategies</h2>


<p>In the third phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the basic
strategy of always rolling a fixed number of dice. First, you need to develop
some tools to evaluate strategies.</p>


<h3 id="problem-8-2-pt">Problem 8 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>make_averaged</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
takes a function <code>fn</code> as an argument. It returns another function that takes
the same number of arguments as <code>fn</code> (the function originally passed into
<code>make_averaged</code>). This returned function differs from the input function in that
it returns the average value of repeatedly calling <code>fn</code> on the same arguments.
This function should call <code>fn</code> a total of <code>num_samples</code> times and return the
average of the results.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You
must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, we write <code>*args</code>.
To call another function using exactly those arguments, we call it
again with <code>*args</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = fn(*args)
...         print(&#x27;Result:&#x27;, result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs = printed(abs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs(&#x2d;10)
Result: 10
10</code></pre>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>make_averaged</code> carefully to understand how it
is meant to work.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 08 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 08</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-9-1-pt">Problem 9 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code> function, which runs an experiment to
determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives the maximum average
score for a turn.  Your implementation should use <code>make_averaged</code> and
<code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>If two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average score, return the
lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a maximum average score,
return 3.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 09 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 09</code></pre>

<p>To run this experiment on randomized dice, call <code>run_experiments</code> using
the <code>&#x2d;r</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py &#x2d;r</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong> For the remainder of this project, you can change the
implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.  By calling
<code>average_win_rate</code>, you can evaluate various Hog strategies. For example,
change the first <code>if False:</code> to <code>if True:</code> in order to evaluate
<code>always_roll(8)</code> against the baseline strategy of <code>always_roll(4)</code>.  You should
find that it wins slightly more often than it loses, giving a win rate around
0.5.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of samples in <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>


<h3 id="problem-10-1-pt">Problem 10 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can take advantage of the <em>Free Bacon</em> rule by rolling 0 when it is
most beneficial to do so. Implement <code>bacon_strategy</code>, which returns 0 whenever
rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points and returns <code>num_rolls</code>
otherwise.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 10 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 10</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, change <code>run_experiments</code> to evaluate
your new strategy against the baseline. You should find that it wins more than
half of the time.</p>


<h3 id="problem-11-2-pt">Problem 11 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Swine Swap</em> rule. The
<code>swap_strategy</code> rolls 0 if it would cause a beneficial swap. It also returns 0
if rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points and would not cause a
swap. Otherwise, the strategy rolls <code>num_rolls</code>.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 11 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 11</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, update <code>run_experiments</code> to evaluate
your new strategy against the baseline.  You should find that it gives a
significant edge over <code>always_roll(4)</code>.</p>


<h3 id="optional-problem-12-0-pt">Optional: Problem 12 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other ideas you
have to achieve a high win rate against the <code>always_roll(4)</code> strategy. Some
suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>swap_strategy</code> is a good default strategy to start with.</li>
  <li>There's no point in scoring more than 100. Check whether you can win by
  rolling 0, 1 or 2 dice. If you are in the lead, you might take fewer risks.</li>
  <li>Try to force a beneficial swap.</li>
  <li>Choose the <code>num_rolls</code> and <code>margin</code> arguments carefully.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check that your final strategy is valid by running Ok.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 12</code></pre>

<p>You can also check your exact final winrate by running</p>

<pre><code>python3 calc.py</code></pre>

<p>At this point, run the entire autograder to see if there are any tests
that don't pass.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>Once you are satisfied, submit to Ok to complete the project.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;submit</code></pre>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>

<p>The GUI will alternate which player is controlled by you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS 61A project! If you
haven't already, relax and enjoy a few games of Hog with a friend.</p>
